## **Overview**
This project investigates the intricate relationships between **sleep quality**, **stress levels**, and **lifestyle factors** such as **BMI**, **daily physical activity**, and **occupation-related stress**. By analyzing patterns and correlations in the dataset, we uncover meaningful insights into how these factors affect health outcomes.

## **Key Insights**
1. **Gender and BMI:**
   - A higher percentage of females in the dataset are overweight compared to males.
   - Males dominate the "Normal" BMI category, highlighting potential gender-based health differences.

2. **Sleep Disorders:**
   - Overweight individuals are significantly more likely to suffer from **insomnia** and **sleep apnea**, suggesting links to broader health concerns.
   - Sleep apnea and insomnia contribute to slightly elevated stress levels (~0.5 difference compared to individuals without sleep disorders).

3. **Stress and Occupation:**
   - Stress levels are inversely correlated with sleep quality. Occupations such as **Salesperson** and **Scientist** exhibit the highest stress levels, while **Teacher** and **Engineer** have the lowest.

4. **Heart Rate and BMI:**
   - Individuals with **Normal BMI** tend to have low resting heart rates, while overweight individuals show increased resting heart rates, and obese individuals consistently exhibit high heart rates.

5. **Physical Activity and Stress:**
   - Moderate physical activity reduces stress levels. However, excessive exercise correlates with increased stress, possibly indicating athletic training or overexertion.

6. **Stress Levels and Steps:**
   - Individuals who walk between **5,000-10,000 steps daily** show the lowest stress levels, highlighting the importance of daily physical activity for mental well-being.

## **Project Tools**
1. **Power BI**:
   - Used to create the visual dashboards for exploring insights.
   - Enabled interactive analysis of BMI categories, sleep disorders, stress levels, and occupations.

2. **Streamlit**:
   - A lightweight web application framework for building an interactive and user-friendly platform.
   - Showcases real-time data visualizations and user-specific insights based on selected filters.

---

## **Features**
- **Dashboard Highlights:**
  - Gender-wise BMI and stress distribution.
  - Interactive charts for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep disorders.
  - Occupation-based stress and sleep quality metrics.

- **Streamlit Application:**
  - Customizable filtering based on age, gender, and physical activity levels.
  - Real-time updates to visualizations, making insights accessible for various user needs.

---

## **How to Run**
1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone <repository-link>`.
2. Open the Power BI dashboard files for analysis.
3. To run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

---

## **Future Scope**
- Expand the dataset to include more demographic details.
- Introduce predictive modeling to identify individuals at risk of stress-induced sleep disorders.
- Enhance the Streamlit app with ML-based recommendations for healthier lifestyles.
